This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a simplified global COVID-19 dataset. The dataset contains country-wise daily information on confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths, allowing us to understand how the pandemic progressed across different regions of the world. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project analyzes global trends, identifies the most affected countries, visualizes the rise of cases over time, and compares death counts across nations. The analysis includes line charts for global confirmed and death cases, bar charts for the top ten affected countries, and country-specific case progression (e.g., India). Additional calculations such as active cases are also included to give a clearer picture of the pandemic's burden. The project concludes with insights showing how cases peaked between 2020 and 2021, how countries like the USA, India, and Brazil were the most impacted, and how deaths followed a pattern similar to confirmed cases. This project demonstrates essential skills in data cleaning, visualization, and extracting meaningful insights from real-world datasets, making it a strong addition to a data science portfolio.
